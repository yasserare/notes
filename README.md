My Notes about anything programming / tech related.


# Virtualization
- It essentialy means creating a simulation of hardware or software in a software environement.
- Its uses:
    * Running multiple Operating systems and computers from the same computer and operating system.
    * 
# Superintelligence  
- Ways of reaching AGI:  
   * AI:  
      - core Features (These are Features that should be considered while developping and are not an after thought):  
            * It should be able to learn.  
            * dealing with probablity and uncertainty.  
            * derive concpets from sensory data and use them (concepts) in reasoning.  
      - Everything evolution acheieved, Human engineering can achieve tha same.including AI (opposed to human intelligence) as moravec said:  
      `The existence of several examples of intelligence designed under these
      constraints should give us great confidence that we can achieve the same in
      short order. The situation is analogous to the history of heavier than air flight,
      where birds, bats and insects clearly demonstrated the possibility before our
      culture mastered it`  
      - computation power is the issue here, we need super computers to run algorithms so we can mimic >= human level intelligence.  
      - even with moore's law, It will probably take so long to reach computation that would help reach AI.  
   * Whole brain emulation:
      - Taking a dead person's brain, slicing it, scanning it and producing a software version of the brain that can either inhabit a robot or just be ran virtually on a pc.
      - It does not need any Major breakthroughs but it needs very advanced technology.
      - The technological capabilities needed to reach whole brain emulation are much more then AI.
      - ALthough not entirely, This path is less dangerous than the AI path because we can see it coming from a mile way (not entirely) because it will needs to work on multiple organisms before it works on humans. (see Whole brain emulation roadmap)
   * biological cognition:
     - Actaully "Improving" the human brain through techniques such as iterative embryo selection and other techniques.
     - It will probably take too much to achieve superintelligence whereas Previous techniques like AI might have already reached superintelligence.
   * brain-computer interfaces:
     - Basically means cyborgs, Imagine something like DBS system for parkinson but way more advanced.
     - but this path is unlikely because such system could cause so many complications and other paths are way more feasible and have lower risks for the safety of the user.
   * Networks and organizations:
      - Imagine a web or organization where only highly intelligent people connect with each other, share informations and their only objective individualy is to engage in highly intelectual disscusions.
# AGING  
# SSH  
   * Secure Shell (which is not a shell at all, the name comes from the rsh program which is used for remote login) is a program that enables logging into a remote machine and excuting commands on that machine, it is also be used in other tools such as  sftp and scp to transfer files (s in sftp and scp stands secure and they are upgrades of ftp and rcp which are the original versions).
   * it core benefit is its security, thus replacing programs like telnet and rlogin which are both used for remote login and rhs for remote login.
   * ssh is not a shel in the same sense of a bash, it does interpret commands or have commands history or anything like that.
   `[questions to answer] `
      `how does it really work ? like really ?`
      `how do sys admins actually use it ? and how normal users can use it ?`  
       `read that summary`
