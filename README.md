My Notes about anything programming / tech related.


# Virtualization
- It essentialy means creating a simulation of hardware or software in a software environement.
- Its uses:
    * Running multiple Operating systems and computers from the same computer and operating system.
    * 
# Superintelligence  
- Ways of reaching AGI:  
* AI:  
- core Features (These are Features that should be considered while developping and are not an after thought):  
* It should be able to learn.  
* dealing with probablity and uncertainty.  
* derive concpets from sensory data and use them (concepts) in reasoning.  
- Everything evolution acheieved, Human engineering can achieve tha same.including AI (opposed to human intelligence) as moravec said:  
      `The existence of several examples of intelligence designed under these
      constraints should give us great confidence that we can achieve the same in
      short order. The situation is analogous to the history of heavier than air flight,
      where birds, bats and insects clearly demonstrated the possibility before our
      culture mastered it`  
- computation power is the issue here, we need super computers to run algorithms so we can mimic >= human level intelligence.  
- even with moore's law, It will probably take so long to reach computation that would help reach AI.
